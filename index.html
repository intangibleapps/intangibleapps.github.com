        <h2>Building apps that make life more fun, since 2010</h2>
        
        <h3>What We're All About</h3>
        <p>We want to bring the experience of modern, designer board games to
        new audiences. We believe that modern mobile devices minimize the
        barrier-to-entry for board games by eliminating physical storage
        constraints, tedious setup and cleanup, and the need to always have a
        partner to play with.</p>

        <h3>Our Team</h3>
        
        <p>We are a team of 3 talented software developers with over 12 years of
        combined professional experience. The software we've written is used by
        hundreds of thousands of users. Our team consists of Mike Dellanoce,
        Brad Fitzwater, and Brian Hazzard.</p>

            <dt>Mike Dellanoce</dt>
                <dd>Mike Dellanoce taught himself to program at age 16 by
                writing games with C++ and DirectX. Since graduating from
                Virginia Tech's computer science program, Mike has been
                developing large scale web applications for Rackspace where he
                has established himself as a technical leader and all-around
                programming savant. Outside of work Mike tinkers with the
                hottest new technologies, contributes to open source projects,
                and writes on his blog. Mike met Brad and Brian at Rackspace and
                discovered a common passion for mobile game development.</dd>
            <dt>Brad Fitzwater</dt>
                <dd>Brad Fitzwater has been writing software since he was 17.
                After six years at Marshall University, Brad earned two
                Bachelors' degrees (Business and Computer Science), with a minor
                in Mathematics.  During his senior year, Brad was awarded
                Marshall University's "Computer Science student of the Year" and
                was one of 15 science and engineering students selected to
                present original research at the STaR Symposium, sponsored by
                NASA.  Since graduation, Brad has worked on Content Management
                Systems and Geographic Information Systems. At Rackspace, Brad
                worked on a large scale web application, where he met Mike and
                Brian.</dd>
            <dt>Brian Hazzard</dt>
                <dd>Brian Hazzard is passionate about two things: software, and
                board games. After graduating Magna Cum Laude from James Madison
                University with a degree in Business, he pursued a career in the
                software industry. First, he developed tax software at Fast
                Enterprises that state governments depend on for collecting
                revenue. Next, he worked as a Technical Product Manager on a
                web-app that Rackspace customers rely on for business-critical
                hosted IT infrastructure. Now, he is combining his passions to
                create high-quality board game apps that gamers and their
                friends and family can rely on for an enjoyable way to connect
                with each other. His interest in board games was sparked by the
                iOS versions of Carcassonne, Medici, and Ra, so it is fitting
                that Brian will make his mark by creating brilliant board games
                on a brilliant platform.</dd>
